## 💡 Talking Points for Your Presentation

### Introduction (1 minute)
"I created an interactive webpage demonstrating Generative Adversarial Networks, using AI assistance while applying critical thinking to improve the generated code."

### AI Interaction (2 minutes)
"I used Claude AI with three prompt iterations:
1. First, a basic request that gave simple structure
2. Then, a more specific prompt adding requirements
3. Finally, a detailed prompt with exact specifications

Each iteration improved the output quality significantly."

### Code Improvements (2 minutes)
"The AI provided a solid foundation, but I enhanced it with:
- Professional design system with CSS variables
- Realistic training simulation based on GAN research
- Custom Canvas chart visualization
- Quality-aware sample generation
- Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts"

### Interactive Demo (3 minutes)
[Show live demo]
- "Watch the training simulator in action"
- "Adjust parameters to see real-time impact"
- "Explore the architecture components"
- "Compare original vs modified code"

### Learning Outcomes (1 minute)
"This project taught me:
- How to effectively prompt AI tools
- When to accept vs modify AI suggestions
- Web development best practices
- GAN architecture and training dynamics"

### Conclusion (1 minute)
"By combining AI assistance with human expertise, I created a production-quality educational tool that demonstrates both technical skill and critical thinking."
